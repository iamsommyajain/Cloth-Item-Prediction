# Cloth-Item-Prediction

This project leverages the Fashion MNIST dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, achieving an impressive 95.7% accuracy in classifying clothing items. The trained model is seamlessly integrated into a Streamlit web application, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

To ensure scalability and ease of deployment, the application is containerized using Docker, enabling it to run efficiently across different environments. The containerized app can be deployed locally or on cloud platforms, making it accessible to a wider audience.

Key Features
‚úÖ Deep Learning Model ‚Äì A CNN trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset for high-accuracy predictions.
‚úÖ Interactive Web App ‚Äì A lightweight, responsive interface built with Streamlit for easy user interaction.
‚úÖ Dockerized Deployment ‚Äì The application is containerized for seamless deployment across different environments.

How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload an Image ‚Äì Users can upload an image of a clothing item.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing ‚Äì The image is resized, converted to grayscale, and normalized.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction ‚Äì The trained CNN model classifies the item into one of 10 categories.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Output ‚Äì The predicted class is displayed along with the confidence score.

This project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning and MLOps, making AI-powered fashion classification accessible and efficient. üöÄ
